## Key Concepts & Technologies Practiced

- **Java & OOP** – classes, interfaces, encapsulation, polymorphism  
- **SQL** – schema design, joins, primary/foreign keys  
- **Hibernate & JPA** – entities, repositories, JPQL, relationships  
- **Spring Core** – dependency injection, bean scopes, lifecycle  
- **Spring MVC** – controllers, request mapping, validation  
- **REST APIs** – CRUD endpoints, JSON, exception handling  
- **Spring Security** – authentication, authorization, role-based access  
- **Spring AOP** – before/after advice, pointcuts, logging  
- **Database Integration** – MySQL, JDBC configuration  
- **Build & Config** – Maven, application.properties

## Background

These projects were built through structured Spring Boot training and extended through hands-on implementation to reinforce backend fundamentals and common application patterns.

---

## How to Run

Open an individual project folder in IntelliJ IDEA and run the main application class.
